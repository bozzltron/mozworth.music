            She slips out the backdoor
            When no one is watching
            Makes her way to the sand
            
            And she's all alone
            There for the swimming
            Turns her back on the land
            
            The water is cold
            Air is salty
            As she fights the will of the wake
            
            And she's unaware
            That something is lurking
            And she's swimming to her grave
            
            Down, down, down will she go
            The queen of the ocean
            Down to the heart of the sea
            She sits on her throne
            At the root of the mountain
            Her spirit is finally free
            
            She heard a crack
            Before pain was searing
            Water as crimson as rose
            
            She let out a cry
            That was drowned in the current
            Her body dragged into the cold
            
            Down, down, down will she go
            The queen of the ocean
            Down to the heart of the sea
            She sits on her throne
            At the root of the mountain
            Her spirit is finally free
            
            She'll never return
            But she's not forgotten
            Her shoes still next to the sea
            
            And with them a sound
            Of her mourning mother
            Crying daughter! Please come back to me!
            
            Down, down, down will she go
            The queen of the ocean
            Down to the heart of the sea
            She sits on her throne
            At the root of the mountain
            Her spirit is finally free

              This season's been
              One poetic punch in the face
              Our souls bending under the weight
              When I see your eyes I
              Know you feel the same
              
              And life is unrelenting
              Always feeling attacked
              Always a fight to unpack
              But you don't hold the blame
              
              And girl our ships not sinking
              We just gotta jettison the weight
              All this negative freight
              And set our sails
              
              And who am I
              Just another jerk off the street
              Oh, but I love you complete
              And I know we can't
              Can't back
              Can't back
              
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              
              Please forgive my
              Ignorant place in this mess
              All of my fight I relent
              At least toward you
              
              But when it comes to
              All of this weight that we bear
              I'll carry more than my share
              To make you smile
              
              And know that this season
              It will retreat like it came
              Until we see through the rain
              I know we can't
              Can't back
              Can't back
              
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              We can't back down now
              
              We can't back down now

              From the things you love
              Until we meet again
              
              My heart breaks to see
              When life leads away
              From the things you love
              Until we meet again
              
              Goodbye Colorado
              Goodbye Colorado
              Goodbye Colorado
              Goodbye Colorado
